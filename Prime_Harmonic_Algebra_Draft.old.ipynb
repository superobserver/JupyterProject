    "This work presents a deterministic quadratic sieve that deconstructs base-10 integers into algebraic components—digital root (DR), last digit (LD), and amplitude—across the 24 residue classes coprime to 90. Departing from eliminative sieves like Eratosthenes', this method uses 24 standardized operators per class to construct all composites, leaving primes as unmapped residuals (\"holes\") in a fully ordered algebraic map space. Excluding trivial primes 2, 3, and 5, the sieve identifies all primes with perfect accuracy. Validated up to $n_{\\max} = 10^9$, it scales with exact precision, exploiting digit-based symmetries to reveal structured order absent from the traditional number line.\n",

    "Focusing on twin primes, we analyze the 48 generators for paired classes, proving their insufficiency to cover all addresses via density analysis and contradiction arguments. This yields infinite holes per class and infinitely many common holes (twin primes). We further prove persistent holes and the Epoch Prime Rule (≥1 hole per quadratic epoch), tying operator sparsity to PNT decline. The amplitude difference between paired classes is tightly bound by the variance in starting positions (Var(∆y_x) = 161077), yielding correlation ρ_x ≈ 1 − 161077/(90x)^2.\n",

    "This closed system supports the Riemann Hypothesis through class-specific zeta convergence and provides a non-probabilistic prime generation framework.\n",
