    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This work presents a deterministic quadratic sieve that deconstructs base-10 integers into algebraic components—digital root (DR), last digit (LD), and amplitude—across the 24 residue classes coprime to 90. Departing from eliminative sieves like Eratosthenes', this method uses 24 standardized operators per class to construct all composites, leaving primes as unmapped residuals (\"holes\") in a fully ordered algebraic map space. Excluding trivial primes 2, 3, and 5, the sieve identifies all primes with perfect accuracy. Validated up to $n_{\\max} = 10^9$, it scales with exact precision, exploiting digit-based symmetries to reveal structured order absent from the traditional number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on twin primes, we analyze the 48 generators for paired classes, proving their insufficiency to cover all addresses via density analysis and contradiction arguments. This yields infinite holes per class and infinitely many common holes (twin primes). We further prove persistent holes and the Epoch Prime Rule (≥1 hole per quadratic epoch), tying operator sparsity to PNT decline. The amplitude difference between paired classes is tightly bound by the variance in starting positions (Var(∆y_x) = 161077), yielding correlation ρ_x ≈ 1 − 161077/(90x)^2.\n",

    "The de-interlaced framework, by partitioning the number line into 24 residue classes coprime to 90, not only preserves base-10 dimensional attributes but also binds the multiplicands within each class into permitted configurations'' that govern the cancellation operators' behavior. This binding can be viewed as an entanglement between the operators and the class state: for a given class $k$, the specific arrangement of multiplicands (residues $z \\in R$ paired such that $z_1 z_2 \\equiv k \\mod 90$) ensures that composite constructions preserve digital roots (DR) and last digits (LD), transforming index-space addresses $y$ into base-10 number objects'' $n = 90y + k$ whose primality assessments align across domains. Historical precedents for such bound states abound in number theory's quest to functionalize primes: Euler's quadratic forms, like $n^2 + n + 41$, represent early attempts to bind variables into configurations yielding primes for bounded ranges, yet failing infinitude due to eventual divergence from permitted modular residues (as per Dirichlet's 1837 theorem on primes in APs). Legendre's 1808 polynomial conjectures further sought such bindings but were disproven, while Gauss's logarithmic approximations $\\pi(x) \\approx x / \\log x$ implied probabilistic configurations for prime gaps, spectralized by Riemann's zeta zeros as harmonic constraints on bound states. The twin prime conjecture exemplifies entangled pairs, with Hardy and Littlewood's asymptotic $\\sim 2C_2 x / (\\log x)^2$ reflecting modular bindings that permit infinite resonances modulo $p > 2$.\n",
    "In our algebra, these bound states manifest through quadratic dispersals and harmonic chains, where operators are ``entangled'' with the class state to ensure DR and LD preservation. For class $k=17$, the configuration of multiplicands (e.g., pairs like $\\{7,41\\}$, $\\{11,67\\}$ from $R$) results in composites whose DR/LD match $k$'s (DR=8 mod 9, LD=7 mod 10), enabling deterministic markings while maintaining the quantum-like duality of index and base-10 spaces.\n",
    "Furthermore, the numbers within these configurations exhibit operation power'' proportional to their frequency (inverse period $1/p(x)$) and their capacity to cancel previously unmarked holes---all operators contribute to the probability wave'' (overall density of tests or operations at some limit), but only those with prime-valued bases (z prime) effectively remove existing holes from the probability map by marking deeper into the amplitude superposition. Zonal optimizations leverage this, as the operators' normal dispersive norms prevent over-resonance, allowing pruning of non-penetrative fragments.\n",
    "The ``forbidden'' marking of hole indexes arises from this entanglement: holes are out of phase with the phase-locked topography of operator harmonics, evading troughs via $\\gcd(90y + k, Q)=1$ (Q the master LCM key aggregating periods + skews, encoding global composite clusters to preclude anti-chained values).\n",
    "\\subsection{Quadratic Dispersals: Binding Multiplicands into Operator Starts}\n",
    "The quadratic dispersal $y(x) = 90x^2 - l x + m$ serves as the fundamental binding mechanism, fitting initial chain starts for each multiplicand pair $\\{z_1, z_2\\}$ with $l = 180 - (z_1 + z_2)$ (skew entangling pair sum) and $m = 90 - (z_1 + z_2) + (z_1 z_2 - k)/90$ (intercept preserving modular residue).

For squared classes (4 solutions to $z^2 \\equiv k \\mod 90$), self-pairs add bindings, augmenting to 14 dispersals and slightly densifying markings (~1-2% for twins) but maintaining insufficiency. The operation power here is evident: high-frequency operators (small $z$) disperse broadly, canceling holes with greater efficacy, while prime-valued $z$ (e.g., z=7) target unmarked regions more precisely, reducing the probability map's nulls.\n",
    "Example for $k=17$, pair $\\{7,41\\}$: $z_1=7$, $z_2=41$, $l = 180 - (7+41) = 132$, $m = 90 - 48 + (287 - 17)/90 = 45$ (yielding operator (132, 45, 7, 17)), with chain starts dispersing quadratically to bind permitted composites preserving DR=8, LD=7.\n",

    "The harmonic period $p(x) = z + 90(x-1)$ propagates these bound starts as chains $y(x) + n p(x)$, marking troughs at composites while entangling with class symmetries: DR/LD preservation ensures number objects'' $90y + k$ build coherently, with amplitudes as superpositions encoding compositeness. The permitted configurations'' arise from $R$'s entanglement---e.g., for $k=17$, pairs like $\\{19,53\\}$ (DR $1+9=10\\equiv1$, $5+3=8$; $1\\cdot8\\equiv8=$DR(17) mod 9) bind operators into waves avoiding harmonic over-resonance, enabling infinite holes per Theorem 1. Operators add frequency to the probability wave (density of operations at limit $N$), but prime-valued operators uniquely remove holes by adjacent markings, as their chains phase-lock to unmarked clusters---zonal pruning exploits this normality, forbidding over-coverage.\n",

    "In this section, we formalize and prove the key assertions of our de-interlaced quadratic harmonic algebra. Assuming a scrutinizing audience potentially hostile to novel approaches, we provide explicit, manual proofs grounded in the sieve's mechanics: the finite operator pool's marking density $\\lambda < 1$ ensures insufficiency for complete coverage, while correlations between classes guarantee persistent common holes. These proofs leverage the algorithmic structure (e.g., operator derivations and amplitude superpositions) and empirical validations (e.g., h=1000 simulations yielding persistent holes), with Q as the master LCM key for disharmonic evasions. We begin with lemmas supporting the theorems, incorporating the proof by absurdity for twins: finite twins imply causal forcing between classes, forbidden by self-referential independence. We further extend to multi-class unions: no 6-class combination marks all large y (insufficient $\\delta_\\union$), while some 7-class do (inadmissible coverings), resolving cousin primes and beyond.\n",
